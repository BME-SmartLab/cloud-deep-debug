Datasets: 

* [data/bufferv2](data/bufferv2): Simple buffered producer-consumer path simulation datasets with different generation parameters, including deadlocked and deadlock-free implementations.
* [data/q5m](data/q5m): Queued buffered producer-consumer path simulation datasets with 2 and 3 consumers and different generation parameters, including deadlocked and deadlock-free implementations.
* [data/rest-tree1](data/rest-tree1): REST architecture SLA event simulation datasets with a moderate number of nodes (small, medium, large). Several simulation paths per graph.
* [data/rest-tree2](data/rest-tree2): REST architecture SLA event simulation datasets with a high number of architectures consisting of 15, 20, 25 and 30 nodes. One cyclic simulation path per graph.
